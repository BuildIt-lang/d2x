## D2X

An eXtensible conteXtual Debugger for modern DSLs

This is an implementation of the D2X (pronounced Detox) DSL Debugger library. This repository contains the implementation for the D2X-C compiler library and the D2X-R runtime library. 

Details of all the techniques to implement analysis, scheduling and GPU code generation are explained in our paper [D2X: An eXtensible conteXtual Debugger for Modern DSLs](https://buildit.so/publications) [1]. 

Steps for building this repo, the implementation of the [GraphIt DSL](https://graphit-lang.org) with debugging support are provided in this [companion repo](https://github.com/BuildIt-lang/d2x_cgo23_artifacts). The companion repo also has an implementation of [BuildIt](https://buildit.so) with debugging support and examples of applications built with it.
